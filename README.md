# Unsupervised_cardiac MRI reconstruction
 This project explores the use of a Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM) combined with a U-Net backbone for accelerating CMR reconstruction by learning directly in the k-space domain. Two publicly available multi-coil datasets—OCMR and CMRxRecon—were preprocessed with a custom pipeline that standardized tensor shapes and incorporated physics-based data augmentations. The model was trained using both linear and cosine noise schedules and evaluated under various noise levels with both fully sampled and undersampled k-space inputs. While the model demonstrated reasonable denoising performance on fully sampled data, it consistently underperformed on undersampled inputs, producing images with high-frequency loss, artifacts, and in some cases, near-blank reconstructions. Visual inspection of both image and k-space domains revealed poor interpolation in missing regions, pointing to fundamental limitations of training solely in the frequency domain. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches like score-based and unrolled diffusion models—which predominantly operate in the image domain or leverage hybrid strategies—the proposed model lacked strong spatial priors and effective physical constraints. These results suggest that diffusion-based reconstruction models require joint-domain learning, anatomical supervision, and stronger consistency enforcement to be clinically effective. This work provides a modular baseline for future improvements in diffusion-based MRI reconstruction, while highlighting the importance of domain choice and prior modeling in generative medical imaging frameworks.
